# Write a method that takes in a string of lowercase letters and
# spaces, producing a new string that capitalizes the first letter of
# each word.
#
# You'll want to use the `split` and `join` methods. Also, the String
# method `upcase`, which converts a string to all upper case will be
# helpful.
#
# Difficulty: medium.

#input-sring
#ouput-string
#want the first letter of every word capitalized
#i.e. index 0
#so isolate index 0 and upcase it

def capitalize_words(string)
 array  = string.split 
  array.map! {|word| word[0].upcase + word[1..word.length]+ " "}
  p array.join.chop
