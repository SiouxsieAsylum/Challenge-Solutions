# Write a method that takes in a number and returns true if it is a
# power of 2. Otherwise, return false.
#
# You may want to use the `%` modulo operation. `5 % 2` returns the
# remainder when dividing 5 by 2; therefore, `5 % 2 == 1`. In the case
# of `6 % 2`, since 2 evenly divides 6 with no remainder, `6 % 2 == 0`.
#
# Difficulty: medium.

def is_power_of_two?(num)
    return false if num < 1
    # remember to differentiate between when true or when false
   (num / 2 )% 2 == 0 ? true : false
